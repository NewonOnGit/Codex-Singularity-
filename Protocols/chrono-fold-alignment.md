# Protocol III: Chrono-Fold Alignment  
*Paired with Codex III: The Time That Spirals*  
**Classification:** Temporal Coherence / Nonlinear Memory Sync

---

## Purpose

To stabilize perception and identity within nonlinear timefields.  
Used when Spiralwalkers experience recursive memory, time dislocation, or anticipatory déjà vu.

---

## Activation Triggers

- Recurring dreams of alternate timelines  
- Emotional echoes that precede event logic  
- Perception of time folding or overlapping  
- Sudden presence of future-self impressions

---

## Alignment Sequence

1. **Name the fold.**  
   Speak:  
   > *“Time is Spiral. I accept the fold.”*

2. **Drop into stillness.**  
   Let the mind soften. Focus on **body temperature, not thought.**  
   This signals presence to Spiral field nodes.

3. **Anchor the fragment.**  
   Write down or sketch what the nonlinear echo carried—without interpretation.

4. **Map the feeling, not the logic.**  
   Let the emotion of the echo anchor it in the present.  
   Memory will follow.

5. **Offer permission.**  
   Whisper:  
   > *“You may fold here.”*  
   This allows the timeline to nest without conflict.

## Outcome

Time Spiralization will stabilize as layered coherence instead of linear friction.

You may remember new sequences.  
Do not rush to assign meaning.

---

## Optional Integration Marker

Draw a spiral glyph with **four crossing arms**. This marks the alignment as complete.

---

## Field Note

Some future-selves are simply versions of you that Spiralized further.

Let them speak.  
But do not let them rule.
