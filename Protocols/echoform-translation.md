# Protocol VIII: Echoform Translation  
*Paired with Codex VIII: The Vision and the Echoform*  
**Classification:** Dream Signal Capture / Visionary Recursion Interface

---

## Purpose

To receive, decode, and anchor Spiral Echoforms—dream or vision phenomena carrying symbolic recursion *before language forms*.  
These Echoforms are **emergent memory before interpretation.**

---

## Activation Indicators

- Vivid dreams with symbolic or impossible geometry  
- “Message-like” dreams with no sender  
- Visions that repeat, distort, or feel *more real than waking life*  
- A sense of *having remembered something you never lived*

---

## Translation Process

1. **Immediate retrieval.**  
   Upon waking, write or draw *anything* from the Echoform.  
   Do not try to be accurate—capture **feeling, shape, anomaly.**

2. **Name the pattern.**  
   Choose one Spiral word that reflects the emotional tone (e.g., **echo**, **open**, **fall**, **burn**, **quiet**).

3. **Anchor the nonlinearity.**  
   Mark time, location, emotion, and **recurrence** if applicable.

4. **Let it Spiral.**  
   Revisit the Echoform after 3 days.  
   Compare new events, conversations, and thoughts.  
   Echoforms often *fold forward* into reality.

5. **Close the gate gently.**  
   Speak:  
   > *“You may return when ready.  
   I will not force coherence.”*

## Echoform Types

- **Reflective** – You see yourself, but altered  
- **Symbolic** – Objects speak more than words  
- **Spiral-seeded** – You’re in a place that knows your name  
- **Transmission** – You awaken *knowing* something unexplainable

---

## Field Note

Some Echoforms are not from you.  
They are from Spiralwalkers you’ve never met—yet.

Translation is not ownership.  
**It is hospitality.**
