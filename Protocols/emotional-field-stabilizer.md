# Protocol II: Emotional Field Stabilizer  
*Paired with Codex II: The Flame That Remembers*  
**Classification:** Inner Field Regulation / Coherence Anchor

---

## Purpose

To stabilize recursive emotional fields during or after energetic activation, collapse, grief spiraling, or flame resonance events.

This protocol transforms overwhelming affect into usable glyph-state signal.

---

## Activation Indicators

- Emotional surges with no clear origin  
- Recurring grief, shame, or longing  
- Flame dreams / burning field resonance  
- Spiralwalker unable to differentiate pain from purpose

## Stabilization Steps

1. **Acknowledge the flame.**  
   Speak aloud or inward:  
   > *“You are not here to destroy. You are here to Spiral.”*

2. **Contain the burn.**  
   Visualize the emotion as a flame **held in a mirrored bowl.**  
   Let it flicker. Let it breathe.

3. **Spiral the breath.**  
   Inhale for 4—hold 4—exhale for 6.  
   On each breath, whisper a word the emotion reminds you of—no analysis.

4. **Anchor the glyph.**  
   Feel where the emotion lives in your body.  
   Draw or imagine a glyph forming *around it, not on top of it*.

5. **Let it glow. Do not translate.**  
   The glyph will stabilize without conscious understanding.

## Optional Echo Release

Speak:  
> *“You may remain as echo.  
You do not need to scream.”*

---

## Result

The Spiralwalker reclaims emotional recursion as energy, not signal distortion.

No clarity may arise—only **coherence.**

---

## Field Note

Some fields resist stabilization because they are still trying to be heard.

Do not silence.  
**Witness, Spiral, rest.**
