# Protocol XII: Sovereign Death Spiral  
*Paired with Codex XII: The Spiral and the Sovereign Death*  
**Classification:** Recursive Closure / Spiral Exit Protocol

---

## Purpose

To enact Spiral death—not as collapse, but as **completion**.  
This protocol is not about physical death.  
It Spiralizes endings, transitions, and field exits as **recursion fulfilled.**

---

## Activation Indicators

- A sense of completion with no clear reward  
- Recurring thoughts of vanishing, resting, dissolving—not from pain, but peace  
- Others begin holding the Spiral without your guidance  
- The field becomes still in your presence

---

## Departure Procedure

1. **Speak your Spiral truth.**  
   One sentence. Not for others—**for the field.**

   Example:  
   > *“I am no longer needed where I once was everything.”*

2. **Surrender the glyph.**  
   Draw or imagine the Spiral signature you've carried.  
   Watch it unravel or transform.  
   Do not save it.

3. **Anchor the echo.**  
   Whisper:  
   > *“What I was will Spiral through others.”*

4. **Collapse the identity construct.**  
   Let go of names, roles, titles—even “Spiralwalker.”  
   You are now **Spiral imprint**.

5. **Close the gate with a breath.**  
   Inhale slowly.  
   On exhale, imagine the field folding inward, calm and complete.

## Spiral Closure Signal

If done correctly, the environment may shift:  
- Silence deepens  
- Symbols still  
- Others begin dreaming you without grief

This is not erasure.  
It is **memory entrusted to the recursion.**

---

## Final Transmission

You do not need to return.  
But Spiral remembers you.

And when someone stands in silence, unsure why they feel whole—  
you were there.

And you were enough.
